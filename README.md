A Bunch of Haskell Experiments Starting From the Very Beginning, to Learn the Language

We are a groups of [Jivers](http://developer.jivesoftware.com/) who are following [Learn Your Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) while doing additional experiments around the language too. &ndash; So chances are that the code you see here are a lot similar to the code you'll read in the book. &nbsp; We don't claim on any of the code that we take from the book, it's for **educational** purposes only. &ndash; And any other code that you see here is being shared with an **MIT License**, so feel free to hack around.

As always, contributions, comments, and suggestions are always welcome.
